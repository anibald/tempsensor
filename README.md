Tempsensor

The image shows how to assemble the circuit ( image credits to http://blog.filipeflop.com)
With this prototype you can use multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors all together on a single pin. Arduino will recongnise sensor automatically and display their temperatures on the LCD screen
The Probe[] array is set to hold up to 10 sensors, but you can change for more if you wish. Since you are working with 10 or less sensors no code change is needed.
